    "text": "2 Rules\nNMHockey is a USA Hockey Program. All Players in the NMHockey League must be 18 years or older to participate. Non-check hockey with contact and slapshots permitted will be played. All games are played using the current USA Hockey Official Rules of Ice Hockey, except as fortified below in the NMHockey League policies and procedures.\n\n2.1 Zero Tolerance\nThe NMHockey League fully supports and enforces the USA Hockey Zero Tolerance Policy.\nA penalty (Zero Tolerance) shall be assessed whenever a player:\n\nOpenly disputes or argues any decision by an official.\nUses obscene or vulgar language at any time, including any swearing, even if it is not directed at a particular person.\nVisually demonstrates any sign of dissatisfaction with an official’s decision. Any time that a player persists in any of these actions, they shall be assessed a misconduct penalty. A game misconduct shall result if the player continues such action.\n\n\n\n2.2 USA Hockey Rule Fortifications\n\nGame misconducts: All game misconduct penalties (goalies and skaters) require immediate removal from the game and carry an automatic 1 game suspension per USAHockey rules (Rule 404b). NMHockey will impose a 1 year probation and the league Disciplinary Committee (consisting of the divisional Vice-Commissioners) will review and determine if any supplementary suspensions are warranted. NMHockey views all games of equal value. Therefore the weight and duration of suspensions are independent of whether the action occurred during the regular season, playoffs, or championship games.\nDisciplinary review: All game misconducts are given to the disciplinary committee for further review. This review may result in additional game suspensions, longer probation, or removal from the league. The review process is not taken lightly and all reviews require considerable effort and time to gather information and make fair decisions. Because of the effort and consideration put toward the review, the league requests that all players respect the disciplinary action given and not harass the committee in any way during or after the process is complete.\nProbation: All game misconducts carry an additional consequence of a minimum of 1 year probation. During probation, any additional incident found to be harmful to other players/league or an additional game misconduct may result in further suspensions or removal from the league with no refund.\nFighting (Rule 615): USA Hockey defines fighting as “(Note) A punch, or an attempted punch, thrown by any player in the direction of an opponent, regardless as to whether contact is made, is considered fighting.” Any player receiving a major penalty for fisticuffs shall automatically also be assessed a game misconduct penalty. NMHockey will also levy an additional minimum suspension of 2 games for any player receiving this penalty and go to the disciplinary committee for further review.\nAbuse of officials (Rule 601): A game misconduct may be given for abuse of officials. Any player not designated as the captain that argues or disputes a call with the referee may be assessed a penalty. However, given that this is a developmental league, players may ask for a brief developmental explanation of a call in order to advance their understanding of the game when appropriate (e.g. in between periods or after the game).\nInjury resulting from a penalty: Penalties (e.g. boarding, body checking, charging, checking from behind, cross checking, elbowing, head contact, high stick, hooking, kneeing, slashing, tripping) that result in an injury as determined by the officials carry an automatic game misconduct per USAHockey rules. Any player determined to have faked an injury to get an opposing player a game misconduct will be sent to the disciplinary committee for review.\nLeaving the player’s bench or penalty bench (Rule 625): No player may leave the players’ bench or penalty bench at any time during an altercation or for the purpose of starting an altercation. A major plus a game misconduct penalty shall be imposed on any player who leaves the players’ bench or penalty bench during an altercation.\nConsumption of alcohol on the bench (Rule 601f) Abuse of Officials and Other Misconduct: The use of tobacco products, vaping products or alcoholic beverages by any player or team official is prohibited in the rink area, including the bench areas and off-ice official area. A warning shall be issued by the Referee for the first offense by any participant and any subsequent violations by the same team shall result in a game misconduct penalty being assessed. Consumption of alcohol on the bench or ice is strictly prohibited by NMHockey, USA Hockey, the Outpost Ice Arena, and the MAC. Players found to be drinking on the bench may be ejected from the game and may face additional suspension, up to expulsion from the league. Referees that witness a player or players consuming alcohol on the bench may end the game – rendering the game forfeit. A game forfeiture will result in zero points for both teams in that game. Teams may choose to finish the game with no referees, but it will no longer be USAH sanctioned and all game stats shall be negated.\nNMHockey reserves the right to dismiss any player from the league with a pro-rated refund if they are deemed disruptive or found to be a detriment to their division or league as a whole. The decision to dismiss a player from the league may or may not be reviewed by the league disciplinary committee.\n\n\n\n2.3 Suspensions\n\nPlayers (both skaters and goalies) receiving suspensions will serve their suspension in consecutive games for the team that they are rostered.\nPlayers participating in multiple leagues will serve their suspension across all teams they are rostered. For example, if a player receives an 8 game suspension for a game misconduct in the D division and also plays in the C division, they will be suspended for their following 8 games across both divisions (e.g. 4 games in the D and 4 games in the C).\nAny player serving a suspension is ineligible to substitute in any game at any level for the duration of their suspension. Players may be prohibited from participating in other league functions, such as pick-up games, during their suspension.\nA substitute receiving a game misconduct who is NOT rostered to any NMHockey team may not be allowed to substitute in the league again.\nA substitute receiving a game misconduct who IS rostered to another NMHockey team will serve the suspension on their rostered team(s).\nIf a suspension is given that is longer that the remaining number of games for the season, the suspension must be served at the beginning of the following season. Players will be allowed to attend their clinic/practice but will not be allowed to play in games until their suspension is complete.\nPlayers who quit the league before their probation or suspension is completed will be required to serve the remainder of their probation once they return. In addition, if less than a year has passed they will also be required to serve the remainder of their suspension. If more than a year has passed, they must instead pay a fine equivalent to current skater league fees for the number of remaining games in their suspension. Players will be required to pay the equivalent fine before being allowed to substitute in the league.\n\n\n\n2.4 Discipline Committee\nThe Disciplinary Committee is responsible for arbitrating when on or off ice infractions occur related to the NMHockey League. The committee is comprised of the Vice-Commissioners and the Executive Disciplinary Committee members. Although, the duty of the Disciplinary Committee is to arbitrate and impose game suspensions when warranted, this is not the primary goal. The league strives to use this as an opportunity to learn where the league can improve and to mentor players in hopes of preventing a repeat of these actions.\n\nCommittee Members: See the League Staff link.\nDiscipline Committee Review Initiation: All game misconducts will be reviewed by the committee. However, any infraction on or off the ice regardless of severity may be escalated by committee members for review. Information relating to the infraction will be gathered. This includes; written or verbal statements by the individual(s) committing the infraction, referees, off-ice officials and witnesses.\nDiscipline Committee Decision Process: The Disciplinary Committee shall meet to review the information gathered and make a recommendation to the Executive Disciplinary Committee on course of action. The League Commissioner shall notify the player of the committee decision.\n\n\n\n2.5 USA Hockey Registration\nUSA Hockey registration/membership is required for all participants. All players on each team’s roster, including substitutes, must be registered with USA Hockey. USA Hockey membership provides player insurance. Everyone participating in a league game or practice must be a USA Hockey member or the coverage for all players is invalidated. All players who participate in the league must REGISTER individually on-line with USA Hockey. Participants must e-mail the confirmation they receive from USA Hockey to the League Commissioner before participating in any league activities – games or practices."

    "text": "3 Rosters & Team Formation\nTeams are formed prior to the beginning of each season by random draw. Prior to the draw, all skaters and goalies in each league are ranked into a small number of levels. Each team captain or representative then randomly draws player’s names from a hat in a manner that guarantees all teams have then same number of players from each level. This is to try to achieve parity of teams within a division, reduce animosity between players, and allow new players to easily enter the league.\nTo keep the random nature of the team formation, NMHockey does not allow players to be drawn with other players except in the following situations:\n\nBy relation: Father/Son, Brothers, Husband/Wife, etc.\nCarpooling: Consideration may be given to players who carpool to the games. Players should discuss situation with the league commissioner prior to the draft.\nSpecial Decree: If you have a special circumstance, you may discuss it with the league commissioner prior to the draft.\n\nIn no case may more than 2 players be drawn together and both players must be appropriate to the division in which they play.\nNMHockey rosters 10 skaters and one goalie per team to ensure players receive a generous amount of icetime. Players whose skill level is not comparable to that of their peers may be reassigned or removed from the roster with a prorated refund at the commissioner’s discretion. Any team losing a player during the season, for any reason, will have a new player rostered to their team, chosen by the league commissioner."

Captains are league representatives and are not advocates for their team to the league commissioner. Captains are requested to have a “C” on their jersey, even if the letter is temporary and made of tape. If the team captain is not present, the team will appoint a temporary captain for the game and notify the opposing team captain, referees and scorekeepers before the start of the game. Per USA Hockey rules, goalies may not serve as captain. Only the team captain may discuss issues or calls with the referee. Only the team captain may call a time-out."

    "text": "5 Substitutes\nA substitute is any player playing with a team on which they are not officially rostered. Any rostered player that cannot make their game shall notify their team captain by the divisional vice-commissioner’s cutoff time . Players who miss three games in a season without notifying their captain may be replaced on the team roster without a refund. Player substitutions for individual games will be coordinated ONLY through the divisional vice-commissioner or league commissioner. All substitutes must be approved by one of these two responsible parties. Substitutes are chosen based on matched skill level. However, new players to the league may be brought out to sub where their skill level is unknown.\nAll league policies apply to ANY player subbing.\nAny team acquiring a substitute without divisional vice-commissioner or league commissioner approval risks forfeiture of that game. In addition, any captain and/or players knowingly acquiring an unapproved sub or subbing themselves without prior approval are subject to a game suspension. Exception: A team missing a goalie may acquire a goalie sub of comparable level (plays in the same or lower division) without commissioner approval. We ask that players not solicit themselves as a sub to teams skating short.\n\n5.1 Substitute requirements\nAll substitute players must wear all the required hockey equipment and provide a current copy of their USA Hockey registration via email to the league commissioner prior to playing. Substitute players must own a solid black or blue and a solid white jersey to participate. The substitution fee for rostered skaters is $15, for rostered or non-rostered GOALIES is $10, and the non-rostered skater fee is $20. Players must check-in with and pay the scorekeepers prior to warm ups. All league policies apply to ANY player subbing.\nUSA Hockey registration can be waived for new players the first time they play, but they must have current registration to sub thereafter.\n\n\n5.2 Substitute eligibility\nSubstitute skaters and goalies will be permitted in all games including playoffs and championship/consolation. However, substitute skaters are not eligible to participate in shoot-outs in any game.\n\n\n5.3 Substitutes and game suspensions\n\nAny player serving a suspension is ineligible to substitute in any game at any level for the duration of their suspension.\nTeams are not permitted a substitute for any suspended skater for the first game they are suspended if the suspension occurred for actions that occurred in that team’s game. However, if a team’s goalie receives a game misconduct, they will receive a substitute for all games of the suspension. This includes playoff and championship games.\nA substitute receiving a game misconduct who is NOT rostered to any NMHockey team may not be allowed to substitute in the league again.\nA substitute receiving a game misconduct who IS rostered to another NMHockey team will serve the suspension on their rostered team(S), but their rostered team will be allowed to receive a substitute player for all games.\nThe Discipline Committee may render additional decisions based on the reports and game notes."

    "text": "The NMHockey league has its roots in the summer of 2002 when no league existed for beginner men or women to learn to play ice hockey, where they could have fun and develop their skills in a non-threatening environment. Wanting to play hockey, ice time was reserved at Blades (Now the MAC) for a beginner hockey game. It was hoped that enough people would show up to make two teams. By the end of the night, we had enough excited hockey-player wanna-bes for four teams (teams red, black, blue and white), a ten-week commitment with the rink and the league name of BCHL. This would later become the NMHockey league.\nThe fall season of 2002 saw the league change its name to become the ABHL and change the venue to the Outpost Ice Arena across town. Most players made the change as well. The winter season of 2002 saw expansion to six teams with a seeding of the new teams with a handful of veterans from the original four. Despite the league roster totaling 66 players, the substitute pool/waiting list continued to grow.\nFor the spring 2003 Season, the league grew and split at the same time. Eight teams would split into two levels, a beginner league (ABHL) and an intermediate league (AIHL) and both leagues fell under a new name, “NMHockey”. The ABHL would continue to allow new players to develop and have fun while the AIHL would give developing players a place to further challenge themselves.\nIn the Fall Season of 2005, the league grew and split again to add the competitive league (ACHL) to accommodate players with more extensive hockey experience.\nOver the next couple years the league saw exponential growth; expanding to 22 teams across five divisions. In 2007, the Outpost Ice Arena also expanded, adding a second sheet of ice and during this same period, the league adopted new custom jerseys, which we still use to this day.\nIn the fall of 2011, in an effort to improve the playing environment of the league and in making games more fun and safe, NMHockey introduced the Sportsmanship Award. This award is a partial league credit and a framed Sportsmanship patch given to a player in each division, voted by his/her peers who exhibits characteristics that best meet the league mission.\nIn the spring of 2017, the league expanded back across the river where we started; at the MAC, what was Blades. Eight teams were drafted: four teams on Tuesday (Intermediate-Advanced) nights and four teams on Thursday (Beginner-Intermediate) nights.\nIn the fall of 2021, following a year and a half hiatus due to the COVID pandemic, the league returned with 95% of the players that were rostered the previous year and welcomed the addition of the Sunday “Premier League”; adding an A level to the league divisions (which dissolved in 2024).\nOver 20 years have passed since the league started and it has evolved substantially. NMHockey now has an amazing community of over 300 players and consists of 28 teams; four E Div teams, four D Div teams, four C Div teams, four B2 Div, and four B1 Div teams, all playing at the Outpost Ice Arena and four Tuesday teams and four Thursday teams that play at the MAC. All leagues are sanctioned by USA Hockey, have USA Hockey referees, full time scorekeepers/announcer, league by-laws, league events, a website and a trophy, “The Norskie Cup”, rivaling the Stanley Cup itself (of course, not in importance or nostalgia, but in appearance).\nFor more information about the league, visit the “Season Details” and “Rules & Policies” page ."

    "text": "If you are new to New Mexico and looking to continue to play hockey or you have never played the game before, we have something that will fit your skill level and experience. We take inquires from new players all season long.\nDue to the limited number of roster spots per team, new players typically enter the league as a substitute first. This allows us to evaluate each player and determine which division is the best fit and affords new players the ability to see if the league is a good fit for them. Furthermore, new players are encouraged to reach out as early in the season as possible so we have ample substitution opportunities before the playoffs and before the new season starts. New players that have been subbing are given priority over those that first reach out during new season sign-ups.\nPlease read through the information below, as well as the History , the Rules , Season Details , and New Player Sign-up.\nLeague Format:\nNMHockey currently has programs at two different rinks in New Mexico: The Outpost Ice Arena in Albuquerque and The MAC in Rio Rancho. The league at the Outpost Ice Arena consists of 5 different level divisions with 4 teams in each: E division (Novice), D division, C division, B2 division, and B1 division. The MAC consists of 2 different level divisions with 4 teams in each: Intermediate and an Intermediate – Advanced. All games are sanctioned by USA Hockey and all players must be registered with USA Hockey to participate as a rostered player or substitute.\n\nEach team consists of 10-11 skaters and a goalie.\nSubstitute players are provided (for a fee) for players unable to make their game.\nNew captains are selected at the beginning of each season\nTeam rosters are redrafted at the beginning of each season. Rosters and schedule are then announced at our kickoff parties or via the website.\nEach game has 2 USA Hockey sanctioned referees plus a scorekeeper/announcer.\n\nSeason Format:\n\nSee Season Details for divisional game days and times.\nA season consists of a regular season and a post-season with playoffs and championship/consolation.\nEvery player gets the same number of games regardless of regular and post-season standings.\n\nGame Format:\n\nGames are 1-hr 15-min in length.\n\n20-min runtime periods.\n\n5-min warm up and 1-min breaks between periods.\n5-min 3 vs. 3 OT period for tied games after regulation.\n3 vs. 3 shootouts period for games tied after OT.\n\nEquipment:\nRequired:\n\nSkates (of course)\nStick\nShin Guards\nSocks\nCup or Pelvic Protector\nBreezers (Pants)\nElbow Pads\nGloves\nHelmet\n\nThe following equipment is not required, but is HIGHLY recommended:\n\nChest/Shoulder Protection\nMouth Guard\n\nExtras:\n\nChampionship Cup – “Norskie Cup”\nSportsmanship Award\nDiscounted, high-quality league jerseys for rostered players\nJersey Patches for player anniversaries and championships\nNMHockey.com features league standings, stats, schedule, photos and more.\nNMHockey occasionally hosts social events during the seasons, such as team unveiling parties, Halloween party, etc…"

    "text": "If you have made it this far, hopefully you are interested in joining NMHockey. Below is the information on how to start getting on the ice. Please read through information on the League , the History , the Rules and Season Details if you have not already done so.\nProvide your information: Please send Joe Hanson an email at jhanson@nmhockey with the following information:\n\nName\nPhone Number\nA brief description of your playing experience\nWhich rink, Outpost, MAC or both, you are interested in skating at\nAre you interested in subbing and/or rostering to a team\nWhat night(s) you can play\nUSA Hockey Registration – This can be done online at www.usahockey.com (Forward the email USAH emails you to jhanson@nmhockey.com )\n\nWe will return your email as soon as we can and let you know you are on the list for subbing and/or waiting for a roster spot on a team.\nHow we roster players for each new season: Each of the NMHockey divisions consist of 4 teams. We roster 10 to 11 skaters and 1 goalie on each team in order to optimize each player’s icetime. This means there is a limited number of roster spots on each team, as well as within each division itself. Due to the number of players needed and limited “good” icetime (i.e. before 11PM), expanding any given division is not an option at this time. Priority is given to currently rostered players for one week once sign ups begin. Once we determine in what divisions and how many roster spots we have open, we use the following hierarchy to coarsely determine which players to roster:\n\nPlayers that had the previous season cut short by injury or another emergency.\nPlayers that have been subbing regularly and have been rostered in the league within the past two seasons.\nPlayers that have been subbing regularly.\nAll other players.\n\nIt may appear that it is difficult for players in that last group to get rostered, but we have a pretty good track record of getting most players on a team.\nWe put a lot of effort into maintaining the parity of skill level in each division, while also trying to accommodate player’s personal schedules, development and other special requests. In order to accomplish this, we must consider many factors when choosing which players to sign up to any division, such as:\n\nWhich players have indicated they want a roster spot versus only subbing.\nHow we maintain 4 teams worth of skaters in each division.\nAre there players the Vice-Commissioners recommend moving up or down a division?\nDoes the player’s skill level fit well within the band of a division’s skill range?\nHas a player shown positive behavior on the ice when they played?\nHas a player been subbing regularly and trying to get into the league for a while, but we have not been able to get them in?\nHas a player shown reliability in completing the seasons they signed up for, emergencies withstanding?\nHas a player subbed in the league enough times that we know their skill level?\nHas a player already submitted their USAH registration?\nIs a player in good financial standing with the league? i.e. has paid their sub fees, pay league fees on time, etc…\n\nOnce we have determined which players we feel are the best fit for the available roster spots, we will invite them to sign up.\nAs you can appreciate, based on all this, there are a lot of moving pieces, but it is our priority to ensure we provide a great playing experience for everyone involved.\nHow to Sign up if you already have the league jerseys: Players that are invited to join that have the league jerseys need only make a payment and submit their USA Hockey registration via email. Payments can be made through Venmo or check by mail. See Payment Methods for mailing address.\nHow to Sign up if you need to get the league jerseys: Once new players are signed up, we will provide information via email on how to purchase the jerseys."

    "text": "Registration opening soon for 2026 Spring NMHockey Season!\nWe are starting registration for the 2026 Spring NMHockey season at the Outpost Ice Arena and the MAC. Currently rostered players at the Outpost and MAC will be given priority through Sunday, December 7. Payments may be made by Venmo or check by mail. See below under Payment Methods for details. We especially encourage current league members to sign up early in the process for the upcoming season to guarantee their spot in the league. Please also let us know if you are not able to play next season.\nCurrently rostered players at both the Outpost and MAC may start making payments Tuesday, November 25.\nNew players or returning players should visit the New or Returning Player Information page and reach out via email or text to let me know they are interested in joining a team. Please note, it could take some time to respond as this is a busy time of the season.\nWe always strive to get every player on a team who interested in joining, but given we maintain a limited number of skaters and one goalie per team, it may not be possible to accommodate everyone. Any players we are not able to get on a team may sub (subbing in the league ) when the league starts up. Players that are subbing will be given priority when there is a mid-season opening, based on the best match of skill level for the player they are replacing. Subbing is also a great way to get ice time, determine the best division for a player and provide and opportunity for new players to get to know New Mexico’s great hockey community.\nImportant notes about partial payments:"
