Currently rostered players at the Outpost and MAC will be given priority through Sunday, December 7. Payments may be made by Venmo or check by mail. See below under Payment Methods for details. We especially encourage current league members to sign up early in the process for the upcoming season to guarantee their spot in the league. Please also let us know if you are not able to play next season.\nCurrently rostered players at both the Outpost and MAC may start making payments Tuesday, November 25.\nNew players or returning players should visit the New or Returning Player Information page and reach out via email or text to let me know they are interested in joining a team. Please note, it could take some time to respond as this is a busy time of the season.\nWe always strive to get every player on a team who interested in joining, but given we maintain a limited number of skaters and one goalie per team, it may not be possible to accommodate everyone. Any players we are not able to get on a team may sub (subbing in the league ) when the league starts up. Players that are subbing will be given priority when there is a mid-season opening, based on the best match of skill level for the player they are replacing. Subbing is also a great way to get ice time, determine the best division for a player and provide and opportunity for new players to get to know New Mexico’s great hockey community.\nImportant notes about partial payments:"

Try to identify if there are folks who don’t drink, and either skip them or ask people to bring some Gatorade as well.\n\nGames\n\nFinal say on lines.\nBe nice to the refs. The league has worked pretty hard over the years to develop a good rapport.

There’s always some griping, but just make sure it stays minor.\nPlease wear the captain “C”.\n\nRefs need to know who is “in charge”. Like if a timeout gets called by one person, and someone else says no.\nSome of you might have them already from others, try to take care of them / not lose them, they’re not necessarily cheap to replace.\n\nCaptains timeout\n\nIf teams are getting a bit overheated/chippy, captains can call a captains timeout to try to let some tempers cool down.\nIt doesn’t count towards either team’s timeout.

The base NMHockey jerseys are custom made by Athletic Knit and decorated locally by Sandia Signs. Each player that signs up as a rostered member of the league must purchase a set of the blue and white jerseys. This is the only set of jerseys a player is required to purchase (unless lost or damaged).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShortly after the jerseys were introduced, the league created several different jersey patches to recognize players as they reached different milestones (Patches are only available to those players that have purchased the official NMHockey jerseys):\n5 year patch – Given to players upon their 5 year anniversary as a member of the league.\n10 year patch – Replaces the 5 year patch and is given to players upon their 10 year anniversary as a member of the league.\nSpecial 5 and 10 year patches were created for the founding members that are still playing in the league. They are decorated with the 4 colors of the original 4 teams (Red, Blue, Black and White) for which the teams were named.\n\n\n\n\n\nChampionship patches – Players are given a trophy patch when they win their first championship game in the league. Players are given a championship bar for each division championship game they win. Each divisional level has its own colored championship bar:\n\nBlue = E Division and ABHL\nYellow = D Division and AIHL\nRed = C Division\nGreen = B2 and B1 Divisions and ACHL.\nOrange = Thursday MAC\nPurple = Tuesday MAC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFundraising Patches – In 2014 the NMHockey league held a season long fundraiser for the Carrie Tingley Hospital Foundation. As a part of this fundraiser, a patch set was created to award the top fundraiser from each division. The patch set includes a main patch and a smaller, specific fundraising patch which is placed within the main patch. Future league fundraisers will have the additional specific patches created for them.\n\n\n\n\n\n“MAC 88” Patches – Created in the Spring of 2017 to commemorate the first 88 players to roster at the MAC in Rio Rancho for the inaugural NMHockey season. 44 players were rostered to the Tuesday Intermediate – Advanced division and 44 players rostered to the Thursday Beginner – Intermediate division. Each player received 2 patches to adorn their jerseys."

Captains sitting next to each other are first pairs. Then winner vs winner and loser vs loser.\nFlip coins. First “odd one out” is first draw (may need multiple flips). Second odd one out is second draw. For final two, first one to match the first “odd one out” is third (again, may need multiple flips).\n\nCaptain’s draft in the order of their goalie rank: 4-3-2-1 , 1-2-3-4, 4-3-2-1, …\nIf two goalies are tied in ranks, the captains Rochambeau (best of three) to determine who goes first.\n\nIf all captains prefer, goalies can be drafted first rather than randomly picked. Then the player draft order is based on the goalie rank.\n\n\n2.2 Player Draft\nPlayer ranks\n\nThe outgoing and incoming captains ranked all the players. These got compiled with very complex statistical analysis (an average), and then grouped into “1”, “2”, “3”, and “4”.\nTo enforce a degree of parity across teams, there’s a limit on how many players in each rank you can have:\n\nEach team can have two 1’s, three 2’s, four 3’s, and one 4.\nImportant: The final ranks have been “massaged” to some degree to make sure that each rank has a multiple of 4. There are absolutely players who “should” be ranked higher or lower, but the mechanics mean they have to be “upgraded” or “downgraded”. There is also lot of overlap between ranks.\n\nYou can write the names on the sheet, the colors correspond to their rank.\n\nPlayer sets\n\nThere are a couple sets of players that have to be drafted together.\nWhat we did in the past was:\n\nIf there are three players, you’ll miss one turn.\nIf there are two players you don’t miss a turn.\nIf you all like that, we can do it. If you’d rather not, we can do something different, but we have to decide before we start drafting.\n\n\nDraft strategy\n\nThere are any number of draft strategies.\n\nYou might want to pick the 1’s first, or maybe get who you think is the best of the 4’s.\nYou might think some player is underrated for their rank and grab them early.\nYou might think some player is overrated for their rank and fill up that rank in your team with others players.\nBy the point you’re asked to be a captain, you should be somewhat familiar with most of the division regular and have an idea if someone is over or underrated.\nYou might get “locked in” to a set (or just some players). Like if there’s a set with two 1’s, and each other team picked a 1 already, you’re guaranteed to have that set, and you don’t need to actually select them until the end.\n\nDon’t feel any pressure to draft me. I don’t care if I get drafted early or late, or who I skate with.\nAs players get drafted I’ll remove from the pool and add them to the spreadsheet and show you, so you’ll be able to see who’s still available and how the teams are shaping up."

    "text": "The NMHockey league has its roots in the summer of 2002 when no league existed for beginner men or women to learn to play ice hockey, where they could have fun and develop their skills in a non-threatening environment. Wanting to play hockey, ice time was reserved at Blades (Now the MAC) for a beginner hockey game. It was hoped that enough people would show up to make two teams. By the end of the night, we had enough excited hockey-player wanna-bes for four teams (teams red, black, blue and white), a ten-week commitment with the rink and the league name of BCHL. This would later become the NMHockey league.\nThe fall season of 2002 saw the league change its name to become the ABHL and change the venue to the Outpost Ice Arena across town. Most players made the change as well. The winter season of 2002 saw expansion to six teams with a seeding of the new teams with a handful of veterans from the original four. Despite the league roster totaling 66 players, the substitute pool/waiting list continued to grow.\nFor the spring 2003 Season, the league grew and split at the same time. Eight teams would split into two levels, a beginner league (ABHL) and an intermediate league (AIHL) and both leagues fell under a new name, “NMHockey”. The ABHL would continue to allow new players to develop and have fun while the AIHL would give developing players a place to further challenge themselves.\nIn the Fall Season of 2005, the league grew and split again to add the competitive league (ACHL) to accommodate players with more extensive hockey experience.\nOver the next couple years the league saw exponential growth; expanding to 22 teams across five divisions. In 2007, the Outpost Ice Arena also expanded, adding a second sheet of ice and during this same period, the league adopted new custom jerseys, which we still use to this day.\nIn the fall of 2011, in an effort to improve the playing environment of the league and in making games more fun and safe, NMHockey introduced the Sportsmanship Award. This award is a partial league credit and a framed Sportsmanship patch given to a player in each division, voted by his/her peers who exhibits characteristics that best meet the league mission.\nIn the spring of 2017, the league expanded back across the river where we started; at the MAC, what was Blades. Eight teams were drafted: four teams on Tuesday (Intermediate-Advanced) nights and four teams on Thursday (Beginner-Intermediate) nights.\nIn the fall of 2021, following a year and a half hiatus due to the COVID pandemic, the league returned with 95% of the players that were rostered the previous year and welcomed the addition of the Sunday “Premier League”; adding an A level to the league divisions (which dissolved in 2024).\nOver 20 years have passed since the league started and it has evolved substantially. NMHockey now has an amazing community of over 300 players and consists of 28 teams; four E Div teams, four D Div teams, four C Div teams, four B2 Div, and four B1 Div teams, all playing at the Outpost Ice Arena and four Tuesday teams and four Thursday teams that play at the MAC. All leagues are sanctioned by USA Hockey, have USA Hockey referees, full time scorekeepers/announcer, league by-laws, league events, a website and a trophy, “The Norskie Cup”, rivaling the Stanley Cup itself (of course, not in importance or nostalgia, but in appearance).\nFor more information about the league, visit the “Season Details” and “Rules & Policies” page ."

We take inquires from new players all season long.\nDue to the limited number of roster spots per team, new players typically enter the league as a substitute first. This allows us to evaluate each player and determine which division is the best fit and affords new players the ability to see if the league is a good fit for them. Furthermore, new players are encouraged to reach out as early in the season as possible so we have ample substitution opportunities before the playoffs and before the new season starts. New players that have been subbing are given priority over those that first reach out during new season sign-ups.\nPlease read through the information below, as well as the History , the Rules , Season Details , and New Player Sign-up.\nLeague Format:\nNMHockey currently has programs at two different rinks in New Mexico: The Outpost Ice Arena in Albuquerque and The MAC in Rio Rancho. The league at the Outpost Ice Arena consists of 5 different level divisions with 4 teams in each: E division (Novice), D division, C division, B2 division, and B1 division. The MAC consists of 2 different level divisions with 4 teams in each: Intermediate and an Intermediate – Advanced. All games are sanctioned by USA Hockey and all players must be registered with USA Hockey to participate as a rostered player or substitute.\n\nEach team consists of 10-11 skaters and a goalie.\nSubstitute players are provided (for a fee) for players unable to make their game.\nNew captains are selected at the beginning of each season\nTeam rosters are redrafted at the beginning of each season.

    "text": "If you have made it this far, hopefully you are interested in joining NMHockey. Below is the information on how to start getting on the ice. Please read through information on the League , the History , the Rules and Season Details if you have not already done so.\nProvide your information: Please send Joe Hanson an email at jhanson@nmhockey with the following information:\n\nName\nPhone Number\nA brief description of your playing experience\nWhich rink, Outpost, MAC or both, you are interested in skating at\nAre you interested in subbing and/or rostering to a team\nWhat night(s) you can play\nUSA Hockey Registration – This can be done online at www.usahockey.com (Forward the email USAH emails you to jhanson@nmhockey.com )\n\nWe will return your email as soon as we can and let you know you are on the list for subbing and/or waiting for a roster spot on a team.\nHow we roster players for each new season: Each of the NMHockey divisions consist of 4 teams. We roster 10 to 11 skaters and 1 goalie on each team in order to optimize each player’s icetime. This means there is a limited number of roster spots on each team, as well as within each division itself. Due to the number of players needed and limited “good” icetime (i.e. before 11PM), expanding any given division is not an option at this time. Priority is given to currently rostered players for one week once sign ups begin. Once we determine in what divisions and how many roster spots we have open, we use the following hierarchy to coarsely determine which players to roster:\n\nPlayers that had the previous season cut short by injury or another emergency.\nPlayers that have been subbing regularly and have been rostered in the league within the past two seasons.\nPlayers that have been subbing regularly.\nAll other players.\n\nIt may appear that it is difficult for players in that last group to get rostered, but we have a pretty good track record of getting most players on a team.\nWe put a lot of effort into maintaining the parity of skill level in each division, while also trying to accommodate player’s personal schedules, development and other special requests. In order to accomplish this, we must consider many factors when choosing which players to sign up to any division, such as:\n\nWhich players have indicated they want a roster spot versus only subbing.\nHow we maintain 4 teams worth of skaters in each division.\nAre there players the Vice-Commissioners recommend moving up or down a division?\nDoes the player’s skill level fit well within the band of a division’s skill range?\nHas a player shown positive behavior on the ice when they played?\nHas a player been subbing regularly and trying to get into the league for a while, but we have not been able to get them in?\nHas a player shown reliability in completing the seasons they signed up for, emergencies withstanding?\nHas a player subbed in the league enough times that we know their skill level?\nHas a player already submitted their USAH registration?\nIs a player in good financial standing with the league? i.e. has paid their sub fees, pay league fees on time, etc…\n\nOnce we have determined which players we feel are the best fit for the available roster spots, we will invite them to sign up.\nAs you can appreciate, based on all this, there are a lot of moving pieces, but it is our priority to ensure we provide a great playing experience for everyone involved.\nHow to Sign up if you already have the league jerseys: Players that are invited to join that have the league jerseys need only make a payment and submit their USA Hockey registration via email. Payments can be made through Venmo or check by mail. See Payment Methods for mailing address.\nHow to Sign up if you need to get the league jerseys: Once new players are signed up, we will provide information via email on how to purchase the jerseys."

    "text": "2 Rules\nNMHockey is a USA Hockey Program. All Players in the NMHockey League must be 18 years or older to participate. Non-check hockey with contact and slapshots permitted will be played. All games are played using the current USA Hockey Official Rules of Ice Hockey, except as fortified below in the NMHockey League policies and procedures.\n\n2.1 Zero Tolerance\nThe NMHockey League fully supports and enforces the USA Hockey Zero Tolerance Policy.\nA penalty (Zero Tolerance) shall be assessed whenever a player:\n\nOpenly disputes or argues any decision by an official.\nUses obscene or vulgar language at any time, including any swearing, even if it is not directed at a particular person.\nVisually demonstrates any sign of dissatisfaction with an official’s decision. Any time that a player persists in any of these actions, they shall be assessed a misconduct penalty. A game misconduct shall result if the player continues such action.\n\n\n\n2.2 USA Hockey Rule Fortifications\n\nGame misconducts: All game misconduct penalties (goalies and skaters) require immediate removal from the game and carry an automatic 1 game suspension per USAHockey rules (Rule 404b). NMHockey will impose a 1 year probation and the league Disciplinary Committee (consisting of the divisional Vice-Commissioners) will review and determine if any supplementary suspensions are warranted. NMHockey views all games of equal value. Therefore the weight and duration of suspensions are independent of whether the action occurred during the regular season, playoffs, or championship games.\nDisciplinary review: All game misconducts are given to the disciplinary committee for further review. This review may result in additional game suspensions, longer probation, or removal from the league. The review process is not taken lightly and all reviews require considerable effort and time to gather information and make fair decisions. Because of the effort and consideration put toward the review, the league requests that all players respect the disciplinary action given and not harass the committee in any way during or after the process is complete.\nProbation: All game misconducts carry an additional consequence of a minimum of 1 year probation. During probation, any additional incident found to be harmful to other players/league or an additional game misconduct may result in further suspensions or removal from the league with no refund.\nFighting (Rule 615): USA Hockey defines fighting as “(Note) A punch, or an attempted punch, thrown by any player in the direction of an opponent, regardless as to whether contact is made, is considered fighting.” Any player receiving a major penalty for fisticuffs shall automatically also be assessed a game misconduct penalty. NMHockey will also levy an additional minimum suspension of 2 games for any player receiving this penalty and go to the disciplinary committee for further review.\nAbuse of officials (Rule 601): A game misconduct may be given for abuse of officials. Any player not designated as the captain that argues or disputes a call with the referee may be assessed a penalty. However, given that this is a developmental league, players may ask for a brief developmental explanation of a call in order to advance their understanding of the game when appropriate (e.g. in between periods or after the game).\nInjury resulting from a penalty: Penalties (e.g. boarding, body checking, charging, checking from behind, cross checking, elbowing, head contact, high stick, hooking, kneeing, slashing, tripping) that result in an injury as determined by the officials carry an automatic game misconduct per USAHockey rules. Any player determined to have faked an injury to get an opposing player a game misconduct will be sent to the disciplinary committee for review.\nLeaving the player’s bench or penalty bench (Rule 625): No player may leave the players’ bench or penalty bench at any time during an altercation or for the purpose of starting an altercation. A major plus a game misconduct penalty shall be imposed on any player who leaves the players’ bench or penalty bench during an altercation.\nConsumption of alcohol on the bench (Rule 601f) Abuse of Officials and Other Misconduct: The use of tobacco products, vaping products or alcoholic beverages by any player or team official is prohibited in the rink area, including the bench areas and off-ice official area. A warning shall be issued by the Referee for the first offense by any participant and any subsequent violations by the same team shall result in a game misconduct penalty being assessed. Consumption of alcohol on the bench or ice is strictly prohibited by NMHockey, USA Hockey, the Outpost Ice Arena, and the MAC. Players found to be drinking on the bench may be ejected from the game and may face additional suspension, up to expulsion from the league. Referees that witness a player or players consuming alcohol on the bench may end the game – rendering the game forfeit. A game forfeiture will result in zero points for both teams in that game. Teams may choose to finish the game with no referees, but it will no longer be USAH sanctioned and all game stats shall be negated.\nNMHockey reserves the right to dismiss any player from the league with a pro-rated refund if they are deemed disruptive or found to be a detriment to their division or league as a whole. The decision to dismiss a player from the league may or may not be reviewed by the league disciplinary committee.\n\n\n\n2.3 Suspensions\n\nPlayers (both skaters and goalies) receiving suspensions will serve their suspension in consecutive games for the team that they are rostered.\nPlayers participating in multiple leagues will serve their suspension across all teams they are rostered. For example, if a player receives an 8 game suspension for a game misconduct in the D division and also plays in the C division, they will be suspended for their following 8 games across both divisions (e.g. 4 games in the D and 4 games in the C).\nAny player serving a suspension is ineligible to substitute in any game at any level for the duration of their suspension. Players may be prohibited from participating in other league functions, such as pick-up games, during their suspension.\nA substitute receiving a game misconduct who is NOT rostered to any NMHockey team may not be allowed to substitute in the league again.\nA substitute receiving a game misconduct who IS rostered to another NMHockey team will serve the suspension on their rostered team(s).\nIf a suspension is given that is longer that the remaining number of games for the season, the suspension must be served at the beginning of the following season. Players will be allowed to attend their clinic/practice but will not be allowed to play in games until their suspension is complete.\nPlayers who quit the league before their probation or suspension is completed will be required to serve the remainder of their probation once they return. In addition, if less than a year has passed they will also be required to serve the remainder of their suspension. If more than a year has passed, they must instead pay a fine equivalent to current skater league fees for the number of remaining games in their suspension. Players will be required to pay the equivalent fine before being allowed to substitute in the league.\n\n\n\n2.4 Discipline Committee\nThe Disciplinary Committee is responsible for arbitrating when on or off ice infractions occur related to the NMHockey League. The committee is comprised of the Vice-Commissioners and the Executive Disciplinary Committee members. Although, the duty of the Disciplinary Committee is to arbitrate and impose game suspensions when warranted, this is not the primary goal. The league strives to use this as an opportunity to learn where the league can improve and to mentor players in hopes of preventing a repeat of these actions.\n\nCommittee Members: See the League Staff link.\nDiscipline Committee Review Initiation: All game misconducts will be reviewed by the committee. However, any infraction on or off the ice regardless of severity may be escalated by committee members for review. Information relating to the infraction will be gathered. This includes; written or verbal statements by the individual(s) committing the infraction, referees, off-ice officials and witnesses.\nDiscipline Committee Decision Process: The Disciplinary Committee shall meet to review the information gathered and make a recommendation to the Executive Disciplinary Committee on course of action. The League Commissioner shall notify the player of the committee decision.\n\n\n\n2.5 USA Hockey Registration\nUSA Hockey registration/membership is required for all participants. All players on each team’s roster, including substitutes, must be registered with USA Hockey. USA Hockey membership provides player insurance. Everyone participating in a league game or practice must be a USA Hockey member or the coverage for all players is invalidated. All players who participate in the league must REGISTER individually on-line with USA Hockey. Participants must e-mail the confirmation they receive from USA Hockey to the League Commissioner before participating in any league activities – games or practices."

    "text": "3 Rosters & Team Formation\nTeams are formed prior to the beginning of each season by random draw. Prior to the draw, all skaters and goalies in each league are ranked into a small number of levels. Each team captain or representative then randomly draws player’s names from a hat in a manner that guarantees all teams have then same number of players from each level. This is to try to achieve parity of teams within a division, reduce animosity between players, and allow new players to easily enter the league.\nTo keep the random nature of the team formation, NMHockey does not allow players to be drawn with other players except in the following situations:\n\nBy relation: Father/Son, Brothers, Husband/Wife, etc.\nCarpooling: Consideration may be given to players who carpool to the games. Players should discuss situation with the league commissioner prior to the draft.\nSpecial Decree: If you have a special circumstance, you may discuss it with the league commissioner prior to the draft.\n\nIn no case may more than 2 players be drawn together and both players must be appropriate to the division in which they play.\nNMHockey rosters 10 skaters and one goalie per team to ensure players receive a generous amount of icetime. Players whose skill level is not comparable to that of their peers may be reassigned or removed from the roster with a prorated refund at the commissioner’s discretion. Any team losing a player during the season, for any reason, will have a new player rostered to their team, chosen by the league commissioner."

Captains are league representatives and are not advocates for their team to the league commissioner. Captains are requested to have a “C” on their jersey, even if the letter is temporary and made of tape. If the team captain is not present, the team will appoint a temporary captain for the game and notify the opposing team captain, referees and scorekeepers before the start of the game.

Any rostered player that cannot make their game shall notify their team captain by the divisional vice-commissioner’s cutoff time . Players who miss three games in a season without notifying their captain may be replaced on the team roster without a refund. Player substitutions for individual games will be coordinated ONLY through the divisional vice-commissioner or league commissioner. All substitutes must be approved by one of these two responsible parties. Substitutes are chosen based on matched skill level. However, new players to the league may be brought out to sub where their skill level is unknown.\nAll league policies apply to ANY player subbing.\nAny team acquiring a substitute without divisional vice-commissioner or league commissioner approval risks forfeiture of that game. In addition, any captain and/or players knowingly acquiring an unapproved sub or subbing themselves without prior approval are subject to a game suspension. Exception: A team missing a goalie may acquire a goalie sub of comparable level (plays in the same or lower division) without commissioner approval. We ask that players not solicit themselves as a sub to teams skating short.\n\n5.1 Substitute requirements\nAll substitute players must wear all the required hockey equipment and provide a current copy of their USA Hockey registration via email to the league commissioner prior to playing. Substitute players must own a solid black or blue and a solid white jersey to participate. The substitution fee for rostered skaters is $15, for rostered or non-rostered GOALIES is $10, and the non-rostered skater fee is $20. Players must check-in with and pay the scorekeepers prior to warm ups. All league policies apply to ANY player subbing.\nUSA Hockey registration can be waived for new players the first time they play, but they must have current registration to sub thereafter.\n\n\n5.2 Substitute eligibility\nSubstitute skaters and goalies will be permitted in all games including playoffs and championship/consolation. However, substitute skaters are not eligible to participate in shoot-outs in any game.\n\n\n5.3 Substitutes and game suspensions\n\nAny player serving a suspension is ineligible to substitute in any game at any level for the duration of their suspension.\nTeams are not permitted a substitute for any suspended skater for the first game they are suspended if the suspension occurred for actions that occurred in that team’s game. However, if a team’s goalie receives a game misconduct, they will receive a substitute for all games of the suspension. This includes playoff and championship games.\nA substitute receiving a game misconduct who is NOT rostered to any NMHockey team may not be allowed to substitute in the league again.\nA substitute receiving a game misconduct who IS rostered to another NMHockey team will serve the suspension on their rostered team(S), but their rostered team will be allowed to receive a substitute player for all games.\nThe Discipline Committee may render additional decisions based on the reports and game notes."

    "text": "7 Game format\nGames will be played in three periods, each with a 20 minute run time clock, plus an additional 5-minute 3-on-3 sudden death overtime period if the game is tied after regulation play. If the game remains tied at the end of the five (5) minute overtime period, the teams will proceed to a three-round shootout. After each team has taken three shots, if the score remains tied, the shootout will proceed to a “sudden death” format. All games include a 5 minute warmup and a 1 ½ minute break between periods. Run time is stopped upon penalties, injuries, 2 minute stop clock, team time out, captain’s time out or at referee’s discretion.\n\n7.1 Overtime:\nAny game that is tied after 60 minutes of regulation play shall proceed to a 5-minute sudden death overtime period, to be played at 3-on-3. If the game remains tied after the 5-minute sudden death period, the teams shall proceed to a shootout.\n\nIn the first phase of the shootout, each captain shall select 3 players to participate in the shootout.\nThe home team shall select which team shoots first in the shootout and that team will go first in all subsequent rounds.\nNo player in the penalty box at the end of the 5-minute sudden death period shall be eligible to participate in the shootout in any round. 4 No substitute player(s) shall be eligible to participate in the shootout in any round.\nShooters from each team shall alternate until all 3 shooters selected by their captains have shot, unless the game is decided before all shooters have shot.\nIf the teams remain tied after the 3-player shootout, then the shootout shall proceed to additional rounds of one shooter each until the game is decided.\n\n\nIn each additional round, each team will select a shooter.\nIf the first shooter scores, the second shooter is allowed the opportunity to tie.\nIf only one of the two shooters score, the scoring team wins. If both or neither shooter scores, the shootout continues to the next round.\nWhen proceeding to additional rounds of the shootout, no player may shoot again until all eligible shooters have shot.\nOnce a team has proceeded through its entire roster of shooters, shooters may be selected in any order by the captain, provided that in the next progression through the roster that no player may shoot until all players have shot in that next progression through the roster.\n\n\nDuring the regular season, the loser of the shootout will receive 1 point for an overtime loss while the winner will receive 2 points.\nDuring the playoffs, games are recorded as win/loss. No overtime loss points will be awarded.\nOnly the single game winning goal is recorded as a goal for the team and for the shooter.\n\n\n\n7.2 Penalties in Overtime:\nManpower during overtime will be adjusted to reflect the situation in the game, but at no time will a team have fewer than three (3) skaters on the ice during the overtime period. If a minor penalty is assessed during overtime, the teams will play 4-on-3. If a second minor penalty is assessed to the same team during overtime, the teams will play 5-on-3. As these penalties expire and there are no stoppages, the penalized team adds players until play is 5-on-5. The manpower is adjusted accordingly at stoppages in play to get teams back to 3-on-3 play.\nCase Examples:\n\nCase 1. Team A is assessed a penalty during regulation that carries over to the overtime period. Team B enters the overtime period on a power play, manpower would be adjusted from 5 on 4 at the end of regulation to 4-on-3 at the start of overtime. When Team A’s penalty expires, Team A adds a player to the ice making the manpower 4-on-4. At the first stoppage of play after the penalty expiration, manpower is adjusted back to 3-on-3 (providing no other penalty has been assessed.)\nCase 2. Team A is assessed a penalty during the overtime period. Manpower is adjusted from 3-on-3 to give Team B a 4-on-3 power play. When Team A’s penalty expires, Team A adds an additional player to the ice making the manpower 4-on-4. At the first stoppage of play after the penalty expiration, manpower is adjusted back to 3-on-3 (providing no other penalty has been assessed.)\nCase 3. Team A is assessed a penalty during the overtime period. Manpower is adjusted from 3-on-3 to give Team B a 4-on-3 power play. Prior to the expiration of Team A’s penalty, Team B is assessed a penalty which also creates a stoppage of play. Manpower is adjusted back to 3-on-3 as both teams now have a player in the penalty box. If there is no stoppage prior to the expiration of either team’s penalties, each team adds a player as their penalties expire, making the manpower 4-on-4. At the first stoppage of play after the penalties have expired, manpower is adjusted back to 3-on-3 (providing no other penalty has been assessed.)\n\n\n\n7.3 Game Stoppages:\n\nPenalties: The clock will be stopped when a penalty is whistled. The game clock will resume and the penalty clock will start at the next puck drop.\nInjuries: A stoppage of play for injuries will occur as stated in Rule 206 (e). When a player is injured so that he/she cannot continue play or go to his/her bench, the play shall not be stopped until the injured player’s team has secured possession of the puck; if the player’s team is in possession of the puck at the time of injury, play shall be stopped immediately, unless his/her team is in a scoring position. Note: In the case where it is obvious that a player has sustained a serious injury, the Referee and/or Linesman may stop the play immediately. If the game is stopped due to an injury, the player is not allowed to stay on the ice for the next puck drop, but must go to the bench.\n2 minute stop clock rule: Any game where the score is tied or within one goal with two minutes or less left in REGULATION, the running clock will go to stop time for the remaining time. This does NOT apply to ANY overtime period. Once the clock goes to stop time, it will remain stop time until the end of regulation even if the goal differential is expanded to more the one goal.\nTimeout/Captain’s Timeout: For each game, each team is given one regular 60 second timeout to discuss team strategy, as well as a 60 second “captain’s timeout”. The NMHockey League has established the captain’s timeout specifically to allow captains to better control the overall attitude of a game. If, in any game, the players’ behavior on either side is becoming unruly or dangerous, a captain may call a timeout to meet with the opposing captain and/or referees as needed to discuss how to better control the game. It is also a time for the captains to meet with their own players to calm them down. This is not a time to meet with your players to discuss strategy or criticize the referees; however, you may request of the referees that a game be called tighter. Captain’s wishing to exercise the captain’s timeout should call for time and let the referees know that it is a “captain’s timeout” and ask that the referees summon the opposing captain to confer. In the interest of player’s safety please use these timeouts as needed. However, rarely are these timeouts necessary, as most players understand this is all just for fun."

The reviewing committee will respond to the protest within 72 hours of receipt (unless more prompt response is needed).\nALL referees judgmental decisions are final and are not subject to protest, appeal or review.\nA situation may occur which is not appropriate for protest, but with respect to which a team wishes to complain. In such a case, the same basic procedures as for a protest shall be followed. The result of a complaint will have no effect on a game’s result, but may serve to clarify league, club, team or individual membership actions and policy.\n\nComplaints about player behavior should first be addressed to the team captain. The team captain may then work with the other player’s captain to address the behavior or escalate the complaint to the division vice commissioner. The vice commissioner will then investigate the issue and decide whether there is sufficient evidence to move the issue to the disciplinary committee or close the complaint."

    "text": "In the Fall of 2011, the NMHockey league introduced the Sportsmanship Award. This award was created to underscore the league’s commitment to fostering good sportsmanship and the importance of being respectful to fellow players and officials, bringing a positive attitude and participating in a fair and safe manner. The Sportsmanship Award is given to a player from each division each season who best exhibits these characteristics as voted by their fellow players in their division. The recipient receives a quarter season league fee credit and a framed sportsmanship patch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur past season’s sportsman:\n\n\n2025 Spring Season:\n\nE Division – Caleb Garrett\nD Division – Jake Sisneros\nC Division – Joses Jain\nB2 Division – Tyler Branch\nB1 Division – Brian Heller\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2024 Spring Season:\n\nE Division – Trish Merewether\nD Division – Matt Gordon\nC Division – Akshay Damany\nB2 Division – David Works\nB1 Division – Charlie Villanueva\nThursday MAC Division – Daniel Chavez\n\n\n\n\n2024 Fall Season:\n\nE Division – Brady Corriere\nD Division – Preston Christensen\nC Division – Jane Ferrizz\nB2 Division – Donald Mercer\nB1 Division – Joel Meyers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2023 Spring Season:\n\nE Division – Marshall Stouffer\nD Division – Paul Self\nC Division – Eric Lujan\nB2 Division – Lane Dixon\nB1 Division – Mike Dragoon\nA Division – Graeme Chiasson\n\n\n\n\n2023 Fall Season:\n\nE Division – Jake Sisneros\nD Division – Donnie Newton\nC Division – Jason Davis\nB2 Division – Ethan Dayton\nB1 Division – Toby Rich\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2022 Spring Season:\n\nE Division – John McCauley\nD Division – Michelle Pato\nC Division – Trevor Birt\nB2 Division – Zach Taylor\nB1 Division – Adrian Marziliano\n\n\n\n\n2022 Fall Season:\n\nE Division – Ben Curry\nD Division – Kevin Nowell\nB2 Division – Erika Myers\nA Division – Kenny Greer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2021 Fall Season:\n\nE Division – Akshay Damany\nC Division – RJ Lee\nB2 Division – Caleb Garrett\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2019 Spring Season:\n\nE Division – Daniel Chavez\nD Division – Trevor Birt\nB2 Division – Greg Myer\nB1 Division – Andrew Fierro\n\n\n\n\n2019 Fall Season:\n\nE Division – Stephanie Schultz\nD Division – Trevor Birt\nC Division – Lane Dixon\nB2 Division – Ryan Gutzmer\nB1 Division – Brian Heller\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2018 Spring Season:\n\nE Division – Jamie Gomez\nD Division – Josh Clifford\nC Division – Erika Cole\nB2 Division – Ben Curry\nB1 Division – John Jones\n\n\n\n\n2018 Fall Season:\n\nE Division – Kevin Brewster\nC Division – Marc Blackman\nB2 Division – Jeff Romanowski\nB1 Division – Dan Cassis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2017 Spring Season:\n\nE Division – Sarah Braaten\nD Division – Marc Blackman\nC Division – George Bachand\nB2 Division – Brian Sweet\nB1 Division – Jeff Schultz\n\n\n\n\n2017 Fall Season:\n\nE Division – Stephanie Schultz\nD Division – Dennis Rand\nC Division – Travis Crawley\nB2 Division – Chris Boydston\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2016 Spring Season:\n\nE Division – Jerry Goyer\nD Division – Tristin Anderson\nC Division – Rick Harrison\nB2 Division – David Works\nB1 Division – Nathan Alfano\n\n\n\n\n2016 Fall Season:\n\nE Division – Dawn Gerencer\nD Division – Billy Ninopoulos\nC Division – Daniel Dunn\nB2 Division – Dave Lee\nB1 Division – Daniel Servaes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2015 Spring Season:\n\nE Division – Wendy Hart\nD Division – Mark Ruggiero\nC Division – Kris Metzger\nB2 Division – Jeff Romanowski\nB1 Division – Kevin Cole\n\n\n\n\n2015 Fall Season:\n\nE Division – Michael Aragon\nD Division – David Steidley\nC Division – Peter Bosler\nB2 Division – Mike Geier\nB1 Division – Taylor Cannon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2014 Spring Season:\n\nE Division – Chad Pierce\nD Division – Jane Ferrizz\nC Division – Dan Otter\nB2 Division – Bill Scherzinger\nB1 Division – Erin Crossey\n\n\n\n\n2014 Fall Season:\n\nE Division – Robby Poole\nD Division – Chad Pierce\nC Division – Dan Otter\nB2 Division – David Works\nB1 Division – Rob Ferrizz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2013 Spring Season:\n\nE Division – Leah Dolan\nD Division – Jennifer Salerno\nC Division – Tim Morelock\nB2 Division – Travis Doran\nB1 Division – Tim Jaglinski\n\n\n\n\n2013 Fall Season:\n\nE Division – Jamie Gomez\nD Division – Kris Metzger\nC Division – George Bachand\nB2 Division – Mike Geier\nB1 Division – Tim Jaglinski\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2012 Spring Season:\n\nE Division – Laura Fitzpatrick\nD Division – Travis Crawley\nC Division – Travis Doran\nB Division – Bryan Carbol\n\n\n\n\n2012 Fall Season:\n\nE Division – Betsy Buyan\nD Division – Thaedra Thompson\nC Division – Travis Doran\nB Division – Anthony Allen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2011 Fall Season:\n\nE Division – Amanda Downing\nD Division – Dave Lee\nC Division – Rob Ferrizz\nB Division – Dominique Laroche"
