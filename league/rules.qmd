## I. League Mission

Our goal is to promote the game of ice hockey through the introduction and education of new players and provide an organized, fun environment for seasoned players. The outcome of the games, though important, is not what we are striving for. If, at season’s end, a player can reflect on the season and see improvement in his/her play and/or enjoyed their experience, we have achieved our goal. Simply put, we want a person to become a better hockey player and enjoy the great game of ice hockey.

## II. Rules

NMHockey is a USA Hockey Program. All Players in the NMHockey League must be 18 years or older to participate. Non-check hockey with contact and slapshots permitted will be played. All games are played using the current USA Hockey Official Rules of Ice Hockey, except as fortified below in the NMHockey League policies and procedures.
